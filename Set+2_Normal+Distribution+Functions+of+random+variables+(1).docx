1.	The time required for servicing transmissions is normally distributed with  = 45 minutes and  = 8 minutes. The service manager plans to have work begin on the transmission of a customer’s car 10 minutes after the car is dropped off and the customer is told that the car will be ready within 1 hour from drop-off. What is the probability that the service manager cannot meet his commitment? 

A.	0.3875   
B.	0.2676   
C.	0.5   
D.	0.6987 
Ans)    z- score= 10-45/8  = -4.375
          P value is approximately equal to 0.  So car will be ready within one hour from drop  off.




2.	The current age (in years) of 400 clerical employees at an insurance claims processing center is normally distributed with mean  = 38 and Standard deviation  =6. For each statement below, please specify True/False. If false, briefly explain why.
A.	More employees at the processing center are older than 44 than between 38 and 44.
ANS)         TRUE
B.	A training program for employees under the age of 30 at the center would be expected to attract about 36 employees.
Ans)          FALSE. Because, To determine the number of employees expected to be under the age of 30, we need to find the proportion of employees within one standard deviation below the mean.
•	The z-score for 30 is 30−386= −1.33.
•	the expected number of employees under 30 in a sample of 400 would be     0.0915×400≈36.60.0915×400 ≈ 36.6, so the statement is false.





3.	If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) and X2 ~ N(μ, σ2) are iid normal random variables, then what is the difference between 2 X1 and X1 + X2? Discuss both their distributions and parameters.       
Ans)
•	2X1∼N(2μ,4σ2)
•	X1+X2∼N(2μ,2σ2).
•	The difference 2X1−(X1+X2) can be expressed as X1−X2.
•	The distribution of X1−X2 will be normal.
•	The mean of X1−X2 will be 0.
•	The variance of X1−X2 will be 3σ2 .
•	So, X1−X2∼N(0,3σ2).

4.	Let X ~ N(100, 202). Find two values, a and b, symmetric about the mean, such that the probability of the random variable taking a value between them is 0.99. 
Ans)
z1= stats.norm.ppf(0.995,100,20)
z2 = stats.norm.ppf(0.005,100,20)
(z1,z2)
(151.516586070978, 48.483413929021985)
A.	90.5, 105.9 
B.	80.2, 119.8              
C.	22, 78 
D.	48.5, 151.5 
E.	90.1, 109.9

5.	Consider a company that has two different divisions. The annual profits from the two divisions are independent and have distributions Profit1 ~ N(5, 32) and Profit2 ~ N(7, 42) respectively. Both the profits are in $ Million. Answer the following questions about the total profit of the company in Rupees. Assume that $1 = Rs. 45
A.	Specify a Rupee range (centered on the mean) such that it contains 95% probability for the annual profit of the company.
B.	Specify the 5th percentile of profit (in Rupees) for the company
C.	Which of the two divisions has a larger probability of making a loss in a given year?

Ans)  RANGE= POINT ESTIMATE +- MARGIN OF ERROR
a)	Range =(stats.norm.interval(0.95,540,225))
      b) 5th percentile of profit (X)= 540+(-1.645)*(225)
      c) stats.norm.cdf(0,5,3) = 0.047
         stats.norm.cdf(0,7,4) = 0.0400


A.	Rupee Range= [99.00,980.99]
B.	5th Percentile of profit (Rupees)= 170
C.	Profit 1 has higher probability of making a loss in a given year. Since it has more probability.
