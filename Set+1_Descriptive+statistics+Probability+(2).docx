Answer the following three questions based on the box-plot above.
	What is inter-quartile range of this dataset? (please approximate the numbers) In one line, explain what this value implies.
	What can we say about the skewness of this dataset?
	If it was found that the data point with the value 25 is actually 2.5, how would the new box-plot be affected?


Ans) 
	Inter quartile range is approximately  7.  It implies the  central 50% spread of the data. 12-5=7
	The skewness of this data set is positively skewed since the right tail is longer than the left whiskers.
	If the value of 25 is actually 2.5 then there will be no outliers present in the dataset. This could affect the length of the whiskers due to its  variability.











	
 

Answer the following three questions based on the histogram above.
	Where would the mode of this dataset lie?
	Comment on the skewness of the dataset.	
	Suppose that the above histogram and the box-plot in question 2 are plotted for the same dataset. Explain how these graphs complement each other in providing information about any dataset. 


Ans)
	 The mode of the dataset lies in the value of y  = “5”.
	The skewness will be right skewed since majority of the data falls on the left side and longer tail in the right.hence, “POSITIVE SKEWNESS”.
	Histograms provides a shape of the distribution and how data is spread across different values i.e. “granularity”
Boxplot explains about the median, quartiles, the spread of the data as well as outliers if any.
They both explains the characteristics of the data.



	AT&T was running commercials in 1990 aimed at luring back customers who had switched to one of the other long-distance phone service providers. One such commercial shows a businessman trying to reach Phoenix and mistakenly getting Fiji, where a half-naked native on a beach responds incomprehensibly in Polynesian. When asked about this advertisement, AT&T admitted that the portrayed incident did not actually take place but added that this was an enactment of something that “could happen.” Suppose that one in 200 long-distance telephone calls is misdirected. What is the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number? (Assume independence of attempts.)

Ans)  p: Probability of success (misdirection), which is 1/200.
q: Probability of failure (not misdirection), which is 1−p. i.e, (1-(1/200))

P(at least one misdirected call)=1−(1−(1/200))**
                                                                         =0.0247




	Returns on a certain business venture, to the nearest $1,000, are known to follow the following probability distribution
x	P(x)
-2,000	0.1
-1,000	0.1
0	0.2
1000	0.2
2000	0.3
3000	0.1

	What is the most likely monetary outcome of the business venture?
	Is the venture likely to be successful? Explain
	What is the long-term average earning0.1 of business ventures of this kind? Explain
	What is the good measure of the risk involved in a venture of this kind? Compute this measure
Ans)
	The most likely monetary outcome of the business venture is 2000 with probability having mor i.e, 0.3
	Yes. the probability  that venture will make more than expected seems with the probability  p(x) = 0.2+0.2+0.3+0.1 = 0.8. tells that 80% chance for making the profit.
	The long term average earning of business ventures of this kind  is =
           Summation(x * ( P (x) ) = (-2000)*0.1 +(-1000)*0.1 + 0+ 1000*0.2+2000*0.3 + 3000*0.1 = +800$
	The good measure of the risk involved in a venture of this kind is normally spread of the distribution. high deviation means more chance of risks
                                Standard deviation =sqrt(E(x**2) – E(x)**2)
                                                                     = sqrt(2800000 – (800**2))
                                                               std = 1469.6 
             the variation std is in thousands so there might be high chance of risk due to the wide range of variability.
