CBA: Practice Problem Set 2
Topics: Sampling Distributions and Central Limit Theorem


	Examine the following normal Quantile plots carefully. Which of these plots indicates that the data …
	Are nearly normal?
C is normal nearly
	Have a bimodal distribution? (One way to recognize a bimodal shape is a “gap” in the spacing of adjacent data values.)
D has a bimodal distribution.

	Are skewed (i.e. not symmetric) ?
A is right skewed
B, D are also  skewed

	Have outliers on both sides of the center?
B has outliers  on both sides of the center
A also has outliers

 


	For each of the following statements, indicate whether it is True/False. If false, explain why.

The manager of a warehouse monitors the volume of shipments made by the delivery team. The automated tracking system tracks every package as it moves through the facility. A sample of 25 packages is selected and weighed every day. Based on current contracts with customers, the weights should have μ = 22 lbs. and σ = 5 lbs.


	Before using a normal model for the sampling distribution of the average package weights, the manager must confirm that weights of individual packages are normally distributed.


ANS)
FALSE:
In this case, the sample size is 25, and if the conditions for the CLT are met, the manager can rely on the normal model for the sampling distribution of the average package weights, even if the individual weights are not normally distributed.

	The standard error of the daily average SE(x ̅) = 1.
true
        SE =( 5/25**(1/2))   =1







	 Auditors at a small community bank randomly sample 100 withdrawal transactions made during the week at an ATM machine located near the bank’s main branch. Over the past 2 years, the average withdrawal amount has been $50 with a standard deviation of $40. Since audit investigations are typically expensive, the auditors decide to not initiate further investigations if the mean transaction amount of the sample is between $45 and $55. What is the probability that in any given week, there will be an investigation?
	1.25%
	2.5%
	10.55%
	21.1%
	50%


z-test  = (45-50)/40*sqrt(100) = -1.25  and 1.25
probability between 45 and 55 =  stats.norm.cdf(1.25)-stats.norm.cdf(-1.25)
                             =0.7887
        The probability that there will be investigation is =1-0.7887
                                 P(e) = 0.211=21.1%            
   
         



	The auditors from the above example would like to maintain the probability of investigation to 5%. Which of the following represents the minimum number transactions that they should sample if they do not want to change the thresholds of 45 and 55? Assume that the sample statistics remain unchanged.

	144
	150
	196
	250
	Not enough information
             



	An educational startup that helps MBA aspirants write their essays is targeting individuals who have taken GMAT in 2012 and have expressed interest in applying to FT top 20 b-schools. There are 40000 such individuals with an average GMAT score of 720 and a standard deviation of 120. The scores are distributed between 650 and 790 with a very long and thin tail towards the higher end resulting in substantial skewness. Which of the following is likely to be true for randomly chosen samples of aspirants?

	The standard deviation of the scores within any sample will be 120.
	The standard deviation of the mean of across several samples will be 120.
	The mean score in any sample will be 720.
	The average of the mean across several samples will be 720.
It can be TRUE. Because it has skewed data with mean having high chance to be the average of mean oof an aspirant that randomly chosen will be 720 which falls between 650 and 770
	The standard deviation of the mean across several samples will be 0.60
